# Global Freelancers Analysis (Excel Project)

## Project Overview
Freelancing is growing rapidly worldwide, but raw datasets often come messy and incomplete.  
In this project, I worked with a **Global Freelancers dataset** to clean, organize, and analyze the data in Microsoft Excel.  
The goal was simple: **turn scattered raw information into meaningful business insights**.  

Starting from a raw CSV, I carefully prepared a clean Excel version, created new calculated columns, and built charts to visualize trends in freelancer demographics, earnings, and client satisfaction.

## Project Files
- `global_freelancers_raw.csv` → Original dataset (direct export, unprocessed).  
- `global_freelancers_CLEAN.xlsx` → Cleaned and structured dataset with charts and analysis.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Transforming raw data into something useful meant making a lot of careful choices:

- **Removed unnecessary blank columns** that added no analytical value.  
- **Handled missing values with care**:  
  - For fields like *Age*, *Hourly Wage*, and *Client Satisfaction*, I left blank cells as they were.  
  - Adding artificial values like “0” or “NA” would have changed the meaning of the data and risked misleading results.  
  - By leaving blanks unchanged, the dataset stays **authentic and trustworthy**.  
- **Created a new column – Client Satisfaction**, designed to capture and highlight how clients rated freelancers. This added a valuable business perspective beyond raw demographics.  
- Standardized column formats, checked for duplicates, and ensured everything was **structured and analysis-ready**.

## Charts & Analysis
With the cleaned dataset, I built a set of Excel visuals and pivot tables to uncover insights:

- **Freelancers by Country/Region** – where the global freelancer workforce is most active.  
- **Skill/Category Breakdown** – spotting the most in-demand freelancing areas.  
- **Hourly Wage Comparison** – showing earning potential across categories (while transparently acknowledging blanks where no data was reported).  
- **Age Distribution** – showing available demographics while respecting gaps in data.  
- **Client Satisfaction Analysis** – using the new column to highlight top-performing freelancers and overall service quality.

## Key Insights
- Cleaning the data turned a messy export into a **clear, analysis-ready dataset**.  
- Leaving blanks in *Age*, *Hourly Wage*, and *Client Satisfaction* avoided bias and preserved **data integrity**.  
- Adding **Client Satisfaction** as a feature made it possible to evaluate not just *what freelancers earn* but also *how satisfied clients are with their work*.  
- The charts and dashboards give a strong business perspective: **which regions are growing, which skills are in demand, and how quality of service is perceived worldwide**.

## Why This Project Matters
This project shows my ability to work with **imperfect, real-world data** — to clean it, respect its limitations, and still extract meaningful insights.  
It highlights the importance of **data integrity, thoughtful handling of missing values, and creative feature engineering** in delivering dashboards that support business understanding.
